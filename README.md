# Fantasy Football Draft Assist

A program designed to assist in fantasy football drafts. Uses a specially formatted excel document to load in the players and provides a way to track who has been drafted as well as roster needs for you and other teams.

Development began in 2017 and was last updated in advance of the 2021 football season where I used it to draft a team that was riddled with injuries and disappointments. Though I don't think this tool is at fault for that...
